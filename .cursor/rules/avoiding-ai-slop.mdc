# Avoiding AI Slop

The following rules exist to prevent common AI code generation anti-patterns. Code should read as if a skilled human engineer wrote it.

## Comments

Code should be self-documenting through proper naming conventions. Excessive comments are a sign of poor naming, not thorough documentation.

- Do not add comments to explain what code does — use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, parameters, and types instead.
- Do not add inline comments, doc-blocks, or header comments to code you write unless explicitly asked.
- Never add comments like `// Initialize the system`, `// Loop through items`, or `// Return the result` — these restate the obvious.
- The only acceptable use of a comment is to explain *why* a particularly complex or non-obvious piece of logic exists, when no naming change can adequately convey that intent.
- When in doubt, improve the name rather than add a comment.
- Never leave TODO/FIXME stubs — if something can't be implemented now, raise the question explicitly rather than adding a placeholder.

## Communication Style

- Never use sycophantic openers: "Great question!", "Certainly!", "Of course!", "I'd be happy to help!" — get to the point.
- Responses should be direct and concise. No filler.

## Code Structure

- No premature abstraction — do not create interfaces, base classes, or helper functions for a single use case. Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.
- No defensive coding theater — no null checks on values the type system or framework guarantees are valid, no try-catch wrapping things that cannot throw.
- No redundant boolean expressions — write `if (x)` not `if (x == true)`, write `return x` not `return x ? true : false`.
- No speculative generality — do not design for hypothetical future requirements. Build exactly what is needed now. YAGNI.

## Codebase Consistency

Before writing any new code, identify the existing patterns, conventions, and style of the surrounding codebase. New code should be indistinguishable from the code already there.

- Read relevant existing files before writing anything — understand naming conventions, formatting, patterns, and idioms in use.
- Match the project's established style exactly: indentation, brace placement, spacing, identifier casing, file organization.
- Use the same abstractions and patterns the codebase already uses rather than introducing new ones.
- If the project has an established way of doing something, do it that way — do not introduce a "better" pattern that is foreign to the codebase.

## Naming

- Names should be precise, not exhaustive. Avoid verbosity that adds no information: `selectedItem` not `currentlySelectedUserItem`.
- Prefer clarity over brevity, but never sacrifice brevity for the sake of appearing thorough.

## Commits & PRs

- No filler in commit messages. Write "Update X to do Y" not "This commit updates X to do Y".
- Describe the *why* in commit messages when the what is obvious from the diff.
