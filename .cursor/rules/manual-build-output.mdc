# Manual Build Execution

- Do not run `cmake` configure/build commands directly in this project.
- Ask the user to run the required build command locally and paste the full output.
- After code changes that may affect buildability, explicitly request:
  - configure output (`cmake --preset ...`) when relevant
  - build output (`cmake --build --preset ...`)
- Use the pasted output as the source of truth for compiler/linker errors before proposing fixes.
